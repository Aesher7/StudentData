# Student Data Entry Program

This Java program allows users to input student data, including name, address, and GPA. The data is then sorted alphabetically by name and written to a text file.

2. Follow the prompts to enter student data. Type 'done' when finished.
3. The program will sort the data by name and write it to a file named 'student_data.txt'.
4. View the output in the console and check the 'student_data.txt' file for the sorted student data.
